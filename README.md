This repository demonstrates a peculiar bug encountered while using Firebase Realtime Database with a React application.  The core problem involves a situation where data written to the Firebase database doesn't immediately update the UI components, even though the write operations are confirmed as successful. This behavior is inconsistent; sometimes updates reflect instantly, while other times a full page refresh is necessary. The provided code samples illustrate the problem and the proposed solution.

The `bug.js` file shows the original implementation exhibiting this intermittent inconsistency.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that uses a combination of techniques to mitigate the issue.  Detailed comments are included in both files.
