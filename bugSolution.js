The solution incorporates several strategies to enhance data synchronization:

1. **`onSnapshot` with Error Handling:** Instead of relying solely on a single `set` call, use `onSnapshot` to listen for real-time updates. This approach handles any potential lag or inconsistencies by actively listening for changes.  Robust error handling is also crucial.
2. **State Management:** This uses a state management solution that automatically handles updates and efficiently reflects data changes in the UI.  Redux or Zustand are good choices for larger projects.
3. **Data Transformation:** The code adds explicit data transformation using `.map()` to ensure proper data propagation and to manage any potential edge cases of the update. 
4. **Debounce Function:** Added a debounce function to prevent excessive calls to the update functions that can flood the server with redundant calls. 

By implementing these changes, the likelihood of encountering the intermittent data inconsistency is significantly reduced, leading to a more reliable and consistent user experience.
